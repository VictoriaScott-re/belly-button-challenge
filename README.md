# Belly Button Biodiversity Dashboard

This project builds an interactive dashboard to explore the Belly Button Biodiversity dataset, which catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels. The dataset reveals that a small handful of microbial species were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare.

## Files

- [`index.html`](./index.html): The main HTML file that sets up the structure of the dashboard.
- [`app.js`](./static/js/app.js): The JavaScript file that loads the data and creates the charts.
- [`samples.json`](./samples.json): The dataset containing information about the samples and their associated metadata.
